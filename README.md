# Trello API Card Creation and Commenting CLI Program

## Overview
This project is a Python-based command-line interface (CLI) program that interacts with the Trello API. It allows users to create cards on a Trello board, assign labels, and add comments to those cards. The program requires **Trello API Key** and **OAuth Token** for authentication, and it uses the `requests` library to make API calls.

The program lets the user input a Trello board, list, card details, and comment content, and then creates a card on a specified list and adds a comment to that card.

## Steps Taken

### 1. **Obtain API Key and OAuth Token**
To interact with Trello's API, the first step is to obtain an **API Key** and **OAuth Token**.

- **API Key**: The Trello API key was obtained from the [Trello API Key Page](https://trello.com/app-key) after logging into Trello.
- **OAuth Token**: The OAuth token was generated by authorizing the app to access my Trello account through the Token Generator. (https://trello.com/1/authorize?expiration=never&scope=read,write,account&response_type=token&key=4ce723d9a5b1e2d799a267ba38717ffc)

### 2. **Set Up the Project**
- **Git Repository**: I created a local Git repository to track the project code and changes.
- **Dependencies**: I installed Python's `requests` library for making HTTP requests to the Trello API.

### 3. Fetching List IDs for the Board
- Each Trello board consists of multiple lists (columns), and to create a card, I needed the List ID.
- I fetched the List IDs using the Trello API endpoint: GET /boards/board-id/lists
- The response contains the List IDs, which I used to determine the list where I wanted to create the card.

### 4. Card Creation
- To create a card on a specific list, I used the Trello API endpoint to create a card: POST /cards
- I provided the following parameters
- name: The title of the card.
- desc: Description of the card.
- idList: The ID of the list where the card should be placed.
- labels: Optional, a comma-separated list of label names or IDs.
- Once I sent the request, the Trello API created the card and returned the card ID.

### 5. Adding Comments to the Card
- After creating the card, I added a comment to it using the Trello API endpoint: POST /cards/card-id/actions/comments
- I provided the following parameter
- text: The content of the comment.
- This step successfully added a comment to the newly created card.

### 6. Testing the Program
- I tested the program by creating a card on a specific list, adding labels, and adding a comment to the card. I verified the changes by checking the Trello board.
- The card appeared on the board with the expected description, labels, and comment.

### 7. Project Submission
- Once the program was working as expected, I created a tarball (tar.gz) archive of the project directory for submission.
